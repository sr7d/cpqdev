# Price Rule Logging on the Quote Record

Debugging and monitoring the behavior of price rules in Salesforce can be a challenging task, especially when you need to track when and if a price rule has fired. Fortunately, there's a straightforward solution that involves creating a custom quote field for each price rule. In this blog post, we'll explore how to implement this logging mechanism on the Quote record in your Salesforce org. This approach works particularly well in an unlimited org without restrictions on the maximum number of fields.

## The Need for Price Rule Logging

Before we dive into the technical details, let's briefly discuss why price rule logging is essential. When you have multiple price rules governing the pricing of products or services in your Salesforce org, it's crucial to have visibility into when these rules are triggered. This information is invaluable for debugging issues, review quotes for approval, and ensuring that your pricing calculations are working as expected.

## Creating a Custom Quote Field

The foundation of our price rule logging mechanism is a custom quote field. For each price rule you want to monitor, create a custom field with the same name. This field should be of the "Date/Time" data type.

1. **Navigate to Setup:** In your Salesforce org, go to Setup by clicking on the gear icon in the top-right corner.

2. **Customize Quotes:** Select "Objects and Fields," and then click on "Object Manager." Find and select the "Quote" object.

3. **Create Custom Fields:** Click on "Fields & Relationships" and then "New Custom Field."

4. **Choose Data Type:** Select "Date/Time" as the data type for the custom field.

5. **Field Label and Name:** Give the field the same name as your price rule or whatever makes sense

Repeat these steps for each price rule you want to log.

## Populating the Custom Field

Now that we have our custom quote field set up, we need to populate it with the date and time when a price rule is fired. To achieve this, we'll create an additional price action that runs last for each price rule. This final price action will use the `NOW()` formula to update the custom field with the current timestamp.

1. **Edit Price Rule:** Open the price rule you want to add logging to.

2. **Add Final Price Action:** Create a new price action as the last step of your rule. This action should update the custom quote field we created earlier.

3. **Field Update:** Choose the action type as "Field Update."

4. **Select Field:** Choose the custom quote field you created for this price rule.

5. **Use Formula:** For the field value, use the formula `NOW()`. This formula retrieves the current date and time when the price action is executed.

6. **Save and Activate:** Save the price rule with the final price action and activate it.

## Preventing Duplicate Rule Fires

One additional benefit of using this custom quote field is the ability to prevent rules from firing more than once for the same quote. You can implement this by adding a condition to your price rule that checks the value of the custom field. If the field has a value, indicating that the rule has already fired, you can choose not to execute the rule.

## Conclusion

Implementing price rule logging on the Quote record in Salesforce provides valuable insights into the behavior of your pricing strategy. With custom quote fields and a final price action, you can easily track when price rules are triggered and use this information for debugging, auditing, and preventing rule duplications. ***This approach is most effective in Salesforce orgs without limitations on the number of custom fields***.
